# Thistle

Thistle is a pixel-art action adventure RPG game developed using the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).

It features elements of exploration, combat, and survival, in a dark, mystical fantasy world.

Additionally, the game is built using a server-for-one architecture, hoping to allow for easy multiplayer support in the future.

> ⚠️ This project is in early development and is not yet playable. The codebase is still evolving, and many features are incomplete or subject to change. Guides to get started as a developer is not yet fully available.

## Getting started

Assets are kept in a separate repository for licensing reasons. Guide to set these up for team members coming soon.

To manage addons, [godam](https://github.com/nilsiker/godam) is used. In addition to these addons, the project also uses `TileMapDual` which isn't included as stable in the AssetLib just yet. Handle using manual git installation.
